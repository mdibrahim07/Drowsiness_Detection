# Drowsiness_Detection
The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a real-time safety tool that uses computer vision to detect drowsiness and yawning in drivers. It monitors eye closure (EAR) and tracks yawns using facial landmarks from a webcam, providing audio alerts to prevent accidents. Built with Python, OpenCV, and Dlib, it enhances road safety.
